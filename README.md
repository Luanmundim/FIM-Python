# FIM-Python
A File Integrity Monitoring using Python
It obviously has some room for improvement in that code, but it was just a simple implementantion of FIM.

Limitations/room for improvement:
  - When you add a new file that its empty, like a empty txt file, the script doesn't recognize as a new file, because it's empty;
  - It's not encrypted, you can use symmetrical encryption
  - You have to run the main part of the programm (not the "main()" function) evertytime, you can put it in a loop.
